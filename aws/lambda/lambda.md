# What is lambda
- You can use AWS Lambda to run code without provisioning or managing servers.
- Lambda runs your code on a high-availability compute infrastructure and performs all of the administration of the compute resources, including server and operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning and automatic scaling, and logging.
- With Lambda, all you need to do is supply your code in one of the language runtimes that Lambda supports.
- You organize your code into Lambda functions. The Lambda service runs your function only when needed and scales automatically.
- You only pay for the compute time that you consume,there is no charge when your code is not running
